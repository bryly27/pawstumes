		  <h1>Want to hire a good developer and not waste time?</h1>
		  <p>This is a guide for companies to read before conducting interviews.</p>
		  <p>Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours! :)</p>

			<h3>Do you know the difference between a front-end, back-end, and full-stack developer?</h3>
			<p>Every single company needs to know the difference between a front-end, back-end, and full-stack developer. Many companies do not know how to use these terms. Don't be that stupid company! If you are looking to hire a front-end developer, don't start asking technical questions that are revelant to back-end stuff. If you are looking for a back-end developer, don't start testing them on front-end technologies. Why would you do that? If you want someone who can do both, they are called full-stack developers!!!! Don't tell people you are looking for front-end and in the end you were really looking for a full-stack. If you find yourself doing this, consider a new job.</p>

			<p>Front-end developer: What you see!!!! html/css/javascript</p>
			<p>Back-end developer: What you don't see!!! php/ruby/python etc...</p>
			<p>Full-stack developer: What you see and don't see.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="grey">
		<div class="container">
			<h3>Did you see their resume, cover letter, portfolio site, github, linkedin, etc...</h3>
			<p>How hard is it to look at their work? Just do it! Once you see their work, you can kind of see if they are a fit or not.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<h3>Know what your company needs.</h3>
		<p>If your company just got funded and you are looking hire one or two developers, chances are you need senior developers. With coding bootcamps on a rise, junior developers are all looking for jobs. If you need someone with experience, put senior front-end, senior back-end, or senior full-stack developer on your job posting. </p>
		<p>Even if your company has been around for some time, you need to differentiate mid-level developers from senior developers. No one ever posts positions up for junior-levels, so guess what, they will all be applying for mid-level positions.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="grey">
		<div class="container">
			<h3>Know your budget!!!</h3>
			<p>This is very important!!! You need to value your developers at the right price.</p>
			<p>In Silicon Valley, a junior developer should be priced between 75k-85k. A mid-level developer: 85k-100k. A senior developer: 100K - whatever you want it to be. Full-stack developers should start at 85k.</p>
			<p>Don't try to de-value developers. If you are trying to pay developers less than their worth, don't expect them to work hard. If someone gives you $5/hour when someone else is getting $15/hour, how would that make you feel. Make your developers happy and they will work hard. Pay them right!</p>
